Extract data from HTML, not by directly calling their APIs. Then, perform data filtering and analysis using Pandas, and finally, save the results to a CSV file.\n","\n","### **Tasks:**\n","\n","**1. Web Scraping:**\n","\n","Use BeautifulSoup to scrape the following data from JustWatch:\n","\n","   **a. Movie Information:**\n","\n","      - Movie title\n","      - Release year\n","      - Genre\n","      - IMDb rating\n","      - Streaming services available (Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, etc.)\n","      - URL to the movie page on JustWatch\n","\n","   **b. TV Show Information:**\n","\n","      - TV show title\n","      - Release year\n","      - Genre\n","      - IMDb rating\n","      - Streaming services available (Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, etc.)\n","      - URL to the TV show page on JustWatch\n","\n","  **c. Scope:**\n","\n","```\n"," ` - Scrape data for at least 50 movies and 50 TV shows.\n","   - You can choose the entry point (e.g., starting with popular movies,\n","     or a specific genre, etc.) to ensure a diverse dataset.`\n","\n","```\n","\n","\n","**2. Data Filtering & Analysis:**\n","\n","   After scraping the data, use Pandas to perform the following tasks:\n","\n","   **a. Filter movies and TV shows based on specific criteria:**\n","\n","   ```\n","      - Only include movies and TV shows released in the last 2 years (from the current date).\n","      - Only include movies and TV shows with an IMDb rating of 7 or higher.\n","```\n","\n","   **b. Data Analysis:**\n","\n","   ```\n","      - Calculate the average IMDb rating for the scraped movies and TV shows.\n","      - Identify the top 5 genres that have the highest number of available movies and TV shows.\n","      - Determine the streaming service with the most significant number of offerings.\n","      \n","   ```   \n","\n","**3. Data Export:**\n","\n","```\n","   - Dump the filtered and analysed data into a CSV file for further processing and reporting.\n","\n","   - Keep the CSV file in your Drive Folder and Share the Drive link on the colab while keeping view access with anyone.\n","```\n","\n","**Submission:**\n","```\n","- Submit a link to your Colab made for the assignment.\n","\n","- The Colab should contain your Python script (.py format only) with clear\n","  comments explaining the scraping, filtering, and analysis process.\n","\n","- Your Code shouldn't have any errors and should be executable at a one go.\n","\n","- Before Conclusion, Keep your Dataset Drive Link in the Notebook.\n","```\n","\n","\n","\n","**Note:**\n","\n","1. Properly handle errors and exceptions during web scraping to ensure a robust script.\n","\n","2. Make sure your code is well-structured, easy to understand, and follows Python best practices.\n","\n","3. The assignment will be evaluated based on the correctness of the scraped data, accuracy of data filtering and analysis, and the overall quality of the Python code.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"YU_opgaCYpcO"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Start The Project**"],"metadata":{"id":"k8ptoMlNQ5zB"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Installing all necessary labraries\n","!pip install bs4\n","!pip install requests"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"VgUheSzI6xN0","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1720553319467,"user_tz":-240,"elapsed":18231,"user":{"displayName":"Sherya Jha","userId":"12004598234783254881"}},"outputId":"fcdb9504-a86d-4819-e306-02461747b95d"},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Requirement already satisfied: bs4 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.0.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: beautifulsoup4 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from bs4) (4.12.3)\n","Requirement already satisfied: soupsieve>1.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from beautifulsoup4->bs4) (2.5)\n","Requirement already satisfied: requests in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (2.31.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer<4,>=2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests) (3.3.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests) (3.7)\n","Requirement already satisfied: urllib3<3,>=1.21.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests) (2.0.7)\n","Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests) (2024.6.2)\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **Task 1:- Web Scrapping**"],"metadata":{"id":"-xHLaFLPn4yC"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#import all necessary labraries\n","import requests\n","from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n","import re\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","from urllib.parse import urljoin"],"metadata":{"id":"omJlLZASQBmU","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1720553323444,"user_tz":-240,"elapsed":445,"user":{"displayName":"Sherya Jha","userId":"12004598234783254881"}}},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **Scrapping Movies Data**"],"metadata":{"id":"NCWbwB1Og3bD"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Specifying the URL from which movies related data will be fetched\n","url='https://www.justwatch.com/in/movies?release_year_from=2000'\n","\n","# Sending an HTTP GET request to the URL\n","page=requests.get(url)\n","# Parsing the HTML content using BeautifulSoup with the 'html.parser'\n","soup=BeautifulSoup(page.text,'html.parser')\n","# Printing the prettified HTML content\n","print(soup.prettify())"],"metadata":{"id":"nPDgza5mQJKr","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1720553329156,"user_tz":-240,"elapsed":1010,"user":{"displayName":"Sherya Jha","userId":"12004598234783254881"}},"outputId":"3a04f867-6cdc-43c8-a2ea-f33dcf7fc57b","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"}},"execution_count":12,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["<!DOCTYPE html>\n","<meta charset=\"utf-8\"/>\n","<meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" name=\"viewport\"/>\n","<title>\n"," 403\n","</title>\n","403 Forbidden\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Scrapping Movie Title"],"metadata":{"id":"jthwPVt1jMEu"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Movie title\n","movie_title_list=[]# List to store all movie title\n","\n","# Extracting all movie titles from  tag and storing them in movie_titles\n","movie_titles = soup.find_all('a',class_='title-list-grid__item--link',attrs={'href':True})\n","\n","# Extracting each movie title from movie_titles and storing in movie_title_list\n","for movie_title in movie_titles:\n","\n","    #
